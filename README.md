## Summary
- **Goal:** Build a robust, modular pipeline to preprocess GTD records and classify attack types under heavy missingness and class imbalance.
- **Key features:** modular preprocessing (imputation, encoding, balancing), clear notebooks for EDA and pipeline, and exportable artifacts (figures & report).

> Note: This is a research project. Results depend strongly on preprocessing choices and the (sampled) dataset used.

## Results ✅
Representative test results (see `reports/` for detailed tables and plots):

| Model | Test Acc | Macro F1 |
|-------|----------:|---------:|
| Random Forest | 0.9997 | 0.9986 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9999 | 0.9986 |
| Gradient Boosting | **1.0000** | **1.0000** |

## Quick Start 🔧
Clone, install dependencies, and open the notebooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GTD-Terrorism-Attack-Classification.git
cd GTD-Terrorism-Attack-Classification
python -m venv .venv  # or use conda
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open notebooks
jupyter notebook "notebooks/Part 1_ EDA_GTD.ipynb"
jupyter notebook "notebooks/Part 2_ PROJECT PIPELINE.ipynb"
```

To run the pipeline in Colab, click the Colab badge at the top of this README and open `Part 2_ PROJECT PIPELINE.ipynb`.

## Dataset
This project uses the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) — a sensitive dataset. Please follow the GTD terms of use and citation guidelines when downloading and using the data.

Recommended workflow:
- Download GTD or a sample from the official source (START / Kaggle mirror as available).
- Place the CSV (or sample) at `data/external/GTD_sample.csv` for quick testing.

---

## Reproducibility & Environment 🧪
- Python 3.10+
- Install packages from `requirements.txt`.
- Set a fixed random seed in notebooks (e.g., `np.random.seed(0)` / `random_state=42`) to reproduce experiments.
- Results (especially metrics on imbalanced data) are sensitive to sampling, preprocessing, and balancing steps.

---

## Responsible Use & Ethics ⚖️
This repository deals with data about real-world violent events. Use it responsibly:
- Do not use this data or models to plan, promote, or facilitate harmful activities.
- Respect privacy and legal restrictions associated with GTD and any other datasets used.
- Document limitations and potential biases in analyses and models.

---

## Contributing
Suggestions to improve the project:
- Move pipeline code from notebooks to `src/` for reusability (e.g., `src/pipeline.py`).
- Add unit tests for data transformations and model training.
- Add a CI workflow for tests and linting.

If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

**Next steps / TODO**
- Upload generated figures to `reports/figures/` and update image paths in notebooks/README.
- Move reusable code into `src/` and add tests.
- Add LICENSE and contribution guidelines.
